sms-cli :: command line SMS sender
==================================

sms-cli is a configurable command line SMS sending tool, useful
for sending text messages for instance from scripts.

Installation
------------
No stable releases have been published so far. To use sms-cli
simply check-out the code from GitHub:
  git clone https://github.com/mludvig/sms-cli.git

Usage
-----
Basic usage is very simple:

  ~ $ sms-cli --recipient +123-456-7890 --message "Some message :)"
  INFO: SMS(Clickatell) sent to 1234567890 with ID: 9a8353aad0cb29

The message can be sent to more than one recipient at the same
time, just use more --recipient (or -r) parameters.

Engines
-------
sms-cli can support a number of SMS gateways by way of "engines".

At this moment the supported gateways / operators are:
* Clickatell   - http://clickatell.com
* MessageMedia - http://message-media.com
* SMS Global   - http://smsglobal.com

Configuration
-------------
Copy the example sms-cli.conf.template file to $HOME/.sms-cli.conf
and fill in the access details for your operator. When using multiple
operators configure each in their appropriate section and then use
sms-cli with --profile option to select one. When no profile is
requested the [default] section will be used.

Development and contributions
-----------------------------
To contribute new engines simply "fork" the source repository on
GitHub, do your development and then send a "merge request" to
push your changes back to the main tree.
